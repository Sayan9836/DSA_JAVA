Queue interface maintains the first-in-first-out order. It can be defined as an ordered list that is used to hold the elements which are about to be processed. There are various classes like PriorityQueue, Deque, and ArrayDeque which implements the Queue interface.

Queue<String> q1 = new PriorityQueue();  
Queue<String> q2 = new ArrayDeque();  

ArrayDeque class implements the Deque interface. It facilitates us to use the Deque. Unlike queue, we can add or delete the elements from both the ends.
ArrayDeque is faster than ArrayList and Stack and has no capacity restrictions.
